## General Information
I wanted to achieve a UI for home assistant that would all be displayed on a single screen of my iphone.  I didnt want to have to scroll to see various entities and their states.  Leveraging various popups and state icons i can see what's going on in our house and interact with it easily.  This is still very much work in development and I have a lot of cleaning up to do but what I will show here has been working for me for a while.  

Oh and I'd like to come up with a better name for whatever this is, suggestions welcome.

Most of this is implemented leveraging the [custom button card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) for home assistant.  This is a fantastic card that has so many capabilities.  There were several times where I would find a module in HACS to do something but then I'd realize I could make one better but just implementing using the custom button card.   More on that below.
